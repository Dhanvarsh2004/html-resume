	<h2>Projects</h2>
	<h3>Dual Axis Solar Tracker:</h3> 
	<p>I worked on a Dual Axis Solar Tracker project that utilized an Arduino and light sensors to track the sun's position. The system 
	controlled servo motors to adjust the solar panel along both horizontal and vertical axes, ensuring optimal sunlight exposure and enhancing energy 
	efficiency throughout the day. By dynamically aligning the panel with the sun, the tracker maximized solar energy absorption, improving power output 	and 
	overall system performance. This approach contributed to better renewable energy utilization and increased sustainability in solar power generation. 	</p>
	<h3>Smart Irrigation System:</h3> 
	<p>I worked on developing an intelligent irrigation system that leveraged IoT for smart automation. The system monitored real
	time soil and weather conditions to optimize water usage, enhancing efficiency in agricultural water management while reducing waste. It utilized 	sensors 
	and cloud-based analytics to provide farmers with real-time insights and automated control, ensuring sustainable irrigation practices. By 	integrating smart 
	decision-making algorithms, the system minimized human intervention while maximizing resource efficiency, contributing to improved crop yield and 
	environmental conservation. </p>
